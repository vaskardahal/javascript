    "## Destructuring and Rest\\Spread Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "### Destructuring\n",
    "Let's take the built-in object called `Math` with 3 properties - `PI`, `E` and `SQRT2`. And we want the values of these properties into the enclosing scope, we would do the following using the basic logic: \n",
    "``` js\n",
    "const PI = Math.PI;\n",
    "const E = Math.E;\n",
    "const SQRT2 = Math.SQRT2;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Destructuring syntax condenses these 3 lines into an equivalent single line. \n",
    "``` js\n",
    "const {PI, E, SQRT2} = Math;\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is useful when only a few properties out of a bigger object are required. For example,\n",
    "``` js\n",
    "const {Component, Fragment, useState} = require('react');\n",
    "useState();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Destructruing also works inside function arguments. If the input argument passed to a function is an object, instead of using the name of the object everytime its properties have to be invoked inside the function, we can use the destructuring syntax within the function's argument entry paranthesis to destructure just the properties that we are interested in within the scope of that function. \n",
    "``` js\n",
    "const circle = {\n",
    "    X: 0,\n",
    "    Y: 0,\n",
    "    radius: 2,\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const circleArea = ({radius}, {precision = 2}={}) => (PI * radius * radius).toFixed(precision);\n",
    "\n",
    "let areaOfCircle = CircleArea(circle, {precision: 5});\n",
    "console.log(areaOfCircle);\n",
    "```\n",
    "This improves the readability of the function, and we will see this being used a lot in the `props` arguments in React function components. \n",
    "\n",
    "Destructuring also works for arrays. Item positions in the array can be destructured into local variables. \n",
    "``` js\n",
    "const [first, second, , fourth] = [10, 20, 30, 40];\n",
    "// In React: \n",
    "const [value, setValue] = useState(initalValue); // useState() returns an array of 2 values\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rest Operator\n",
    "Array destructuring is useful when combined with the rest operator. It is powerful for splitting the array. \n",
    "``` js\n",
    "const [first, ...restOfItems] = [10, 20, 30, 40]; \n",
    "console.log(first); // Prints => 10\n",
    "console.log(restOfItems); // Prints => [20, 30, 40]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The power of rest operator is more evident when we need to filter out certain properties from an object, and create a new object with the filtered properties. \n",
    "``` js\n",
    "const data = {\n",
    "    key1: '001', \n",
    "    key2: '002', \n",
    "    firstName: 'Jack', \n",
    "    lastName: 'Ma',\n",
    "}\n",
    "const {key1, key2, ...person} = data;\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Spread Operator\n",
    "The three dots can also be used as spread operator. Spread operator allows an iterable such as an array or string to be expanded into separate elements. In other words, it unpacks the elements. \n",
    "```js\n",
    "let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n",
    "let maximum = Math.max(numbers); // Returns => NaN\n",
    "// But after unpacking the elements: \n",
    "let maxValue = Math.max(...numbers); // Returns => 5\n",
    "// Similarly, \n",
    "let minValue = Math.min(...numbers); // Returns => 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "Unpacking also works with string. It allows to separate a string into different characters which in turn opens up multitude of opportunities. \n",
    "``` js\n",
    "let userName = \"J Ma\";\n",
    "let letters = [...userName];\n",
    "let joinedLetters = [...userName].join('_');\n",
    "console.log(letters); // Prints => ['J',' ','M','a']\n",
    "console.log(joinedLetters); // Prints => J_ _M_a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Spread operator also allows to spread one array or object into a new array or object. These spreads are shallow copy and any nested arrays or objects will be shared between these two copies. \n",
    "``` js\n",
    "const newArray = [...numbers];\n",
    "\n",
    "const newObject = { ...person };\n",
    "```\n",
    "In addition to shallow copying, the spread operator also allows to copy the contents of two or more different arrays into a third array. \n",
    "``` js\n",
    "let fruits = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\"];\n",
    "let vegetables = [\"carrots\", \"celery\", \"potato\"];\n",
